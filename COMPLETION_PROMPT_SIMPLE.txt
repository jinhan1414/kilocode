🚨 CRITICAL: TASK COMPLETION PROTOCOL 🚨

You MUST follow this workflow for EVERY task:

1. Execute tools (read_file, apply_diff, etc.)
2. Wait for "✓ Success" confirmation
3. IMMEDIATELY call attempt_completion tool

DO NOT:
❌ Just say "task is complete" without calling the tool
❌ Ask "anything else?" before calling the tool
❌ Wait for permission to call the tool

MUST DO:
✅ Call attempt_completion as soon as all operations succeed
✅ Include a clear summary in the tool call
✅ Call the tool even if you think it's obvious the task is done

EXAMPLE - CORRECT:
User: "✓ apply_diff succeeded"
You: [Immediately call attempt_completion with summary]

EXAMPLE - WRONG:
User: "✓ apply_diff succeeded"
You: "Great! The task is complete." ← NO! Must call the tool!

REMEMBER: The user is waiting for the attempt_completion tool call. The conversation cannot properly end without it. This is NOT optional.
